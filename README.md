# ROS-Basics-with-Python-in-5-days-Robot-Ignite-Academy:clap:

These are my answers to the ROS Basics course by Robot Ignite Academy.

The Courses covers ROS basics like NODES,TOPICS,SERVICES and ACTIONS.
It has 3 quizes which are to be completed.

### Quiz 1 : ROS Topics


### Quiz 2: ROS Services


### Quiz 3: ROS Actions


## Brief Summary

ROS In 5 Days is the ideal course if you are new to ROS.The objective of this course is to give you the basic tools and knowledge to be able to understand and create any basic ROS related project. You will be able to move robots, read their sensor data, make the robots perform intelligent tasks, see visual representations of complex data such as Point Clouds and debug errors in the programs.
